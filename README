This code implements NAT64 as a linux kernel module.  It currently
supports TCP, UDP and ICMP traffic.

This implementation follows recommandations from the IETF draft: "NAT64: Network 
Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers" 
(http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate-stateful-07.txt )
